# graphql-book-library

To start this project you should first create two separate terminal instances for backend and frontend.
Afterwards do the following (note, that order matters):
1. In backend terminal instance: Run ```cd [path-to-backend-folder]```, then ```npm install``` and ```npm run server```
2. In frontend terminal instance: Run ```cd [path-to-frontend-folder]```, then ```npm install``` and ```npm start```
